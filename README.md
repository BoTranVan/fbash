# fbterm
Terminal over Facebook Messenger, without continuously running browser instances.

## Installation and Setup

1. Install through npm.
```shell
npm install fbterm -g
```


## Running 

fbterm can be started using the command `fbterm`.
All running fbterm processes can be stopped using the command `fbterm-stop`.
When `fbterm` is initally run, it will prompt the user for Facebook credentials. In subsequent runs, it will use a saved app state.

## Usage

After starting the script on your computer, you can access your terminal by messaging a command to *yourself* on Facebook. You can use most commands through fbterm. 
It will respond with `@fbterm` followed by the standard output, standard error, or other errors. 
fbterm does *not* allow using commands which require user interaction, such as `vim`.

*Note: fbterm is not a truly stateful terminal; it cannot handle environment variables and other functionality associated with terminal state. The working directory is handled manually by parsing `cd` commands. Because of this, compound commands with a `cd` component will not function properly, and may cause unexpected errors.`
